# Memories

Memories is a its core a blog system focused mainly on people's experiences which they do not want to forget.

# Description

Memories is a website built for travelers and overall people who love spending time away from home and wish to spread their joy with other people using their educational posts. It is built using the Angular framework with the help of TailwindCSS and Firebase as its BaaS and the JavaScript language's superset TypeScript. In the future i would like to expand the site's functionality by adding comments, likes and perhaps share links to populate your posts with other people.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
You can also find the site deployed using Netlify here: https://ornate-fenglisu-bd9ad0.netlify.app/

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
